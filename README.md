# project6_Patient_Survival_Prediction

Business Problem: 
The predictors of in-hospital mortality for admitted patients remain poorly characterized. It is important to develop and validate a prediction model for all-cause in-hospital mortality among admitted patients, and identify factors that are most relevant to the ICU survival rate. The goal of this project is to provide clinical research and public health professionals with valuable insights, save lives by increasing patientsâ€™ survival rates, and ultimately bring a positive impact to the community.
